Installation
============
+ Linux

  - If you’re using pidgin 2.6.x, copy this file to your ~/.purple/plugins/ directory.

  - For pidgin 2.5.x use that one.

  - Restart pidgin, go to tools->plugins and activate the STFW plugin. Change preferences as desired.
    If that doesn’t work, you can download the sources and compile it yourself by running the build script. If you get an error, you probably need to install the dependencies (glib and libpurple) and/or adjust the include paths in the script.

+ Windows

  - Download the DLL (thanks to Jon Chin!) and place it in your plugins directory of your Pidgin install.
